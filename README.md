# About Firebase Camp

Firebase Camp is a Study Camp focused on mobile & web application development using Firebase. This is work in progress intended to serve as materials to run one or more training events \(half-day, full-day or multi-day workshops\) where attendees can go from awareness to actionable learning.



# History

As of December 2017, Firebase is a suite of products developed and maintained by Google, to support rapid application development, deployment and evolution across mobile and web platforms. It is a key technology powering the growing trend in \_serverless computing \_where developers and small businesses can effectively outsource their backend development & maintenance to providers like Google, and focus their attention on front-end design \(UI/UX\) instead.

Key to this revolution is the recognition that many required backend services \(e.g., hosting, security, storage\) are increasingly becoming commodity features in modern applications -- with the differentiation being driven primarily by user experience and application performance. From a business perspective, serverless computing also reduces costs, allowing for more on-demand pricing models where the costs of server ownership & maintenance are now replaced by automated scaling, load-balancing and security benefits and a pay-per-use model that minimizes costs during idle periods & amortizes costs for unexpected spikes in demand. In that sense, Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform family, providing both its own core services \(as Firebase\) and seamless integration with Cloud Platform services \(e.g., Storage, BigQuery etc.\) to provide truly scalable & secure operation.

But Firebase actually started off as a very different beast. At it's start, Firebase was essentially just one product - a real-time database that used web sockets and a JSON-like data format, to provide simple real-time data sync capabilities for mobile and web clients.
