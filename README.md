# About Firebase Camp

Firebase Camp is a Study Camp focused on mobile & web application development [using Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/). This is work in progress intended to serve as materials to run one or more training events \(half-day, full-day or multi-day workshops\) where attendees can go from awareness to actionable learning.

# History

As of December 2017, Firebase is a suite of products developed and maintained by Google, to support rapid application development, deployment and evolution across mobile and web platforms. It is a key technology powering the growing trend in _serverless computing_ where developers and small businesses can effectively outsource their backend development & maintenance to providers like Google, and focus their attention on front-end design \(UI/UX\) instead. 

This trend is powered by the growing recognition that many backend services can be commoditized \(general-purpose and repetitive\) and that it is more cost-effective to "rent server resources on demand" than to host, manage and maintain server farms particularly for small businesses with varying levels of customer engagement. With serverless computing, the focus is not on "no servers", but rather on not "owning" the servers that run many of the back-end features or requirements \(e.g., storage, hosting, database etc.\). Instead, these products or features are hosted in cloud-hosted containers that can be run on-demand, allowing your application to be scaled gracefully to handle spikes in demand but remain cost-effective by not utilizing resources during idle periods. By leveraging these cloud integrations, you not only benefit from the security and scale of infrastructure providers like Google Cloud, but you also save on costs through a combination of pay-as-you-use billing and reduction in DevOps ownership.

In this context, Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform family, providing both its own core services \(as Firebase\) and seamless integration with Cloud Platform services \(e.g., Storage, BigQuery etc.\) to provide truly scalable & secure operation. But Firebase actually started off as a very different beast. 

* In its v1 form, Firebase was essentially just a cloud-hosted database that provided efficient and effortless real-time data synchronization across clients \(using web sockets\) with a JSON-like data format that supported flexible schemas and addressability \(reference\) of data at the granularity of individual blobs.
* In its v2 incarnation, Firebase expanded into its first "Backend-As-A-Service" offering -- providing security guarantees \(SSL certificates, access control rules\), user authentication \(multiple providers out-of-the-box\), hosting \(static assets\) and the real-time database in one product -- with SDKs and libraries to make front-end integration for mobile/web fairly frictionless.
* In the current v3 incarnation, Firebase has taken this many leaps forward by understanding that successful applications require not just development support, but also performance \(testing & tuning\) and engagement \(marketing & analytics\) tools to ensure end-to-end lifecycle health -- and making the entire suite available for an affordable cost \(with a free tier for trials\)
